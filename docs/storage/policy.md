# Storage policy
**Your data - your responsibility!**

The Ceph network storage is **NOT** a long-term storage or backup solution. **EVERYTHING IS TEMPORARY, SO CLEAN UP AFTER YOURSELF IMMEDIATELY AFTER EACH JOB!!** You will likely forget about it very quickly after you've done your work, so make it a habit to cleanup shortly after every job. Once studies are published, delete all the data and ensure that for example raw DNA sequencing data is uploaded to public archives and that the corresponding code to produce results in the studies is available somewhere, preferably in a GitHub repository.

Furthermore, if you are no longer employed or studying at AAU, your home folder will be **deleted without notice**, and you have the sole responsibility to hand on any data that should be saved for longer by passing it on to other users, for example your PI, **before you leave**.
