# Usage accounting and priority
All users belong to an account (usually their PI) where all usage is tracked on a per-user basis, but limitations and priorities can be set at a few different levels: at the cluster, partition, account, user, or QOS level. User associations with accounts rarely change, so in order to be able to temporarily request additional resources or obtain higher priority for certain projects, users can submit to different SLURM "Quality of Service"s (QOS). By default, all users can only submit jobs to the `normal` QOS with equal resource limits and base priority for everyone. Periodically users may submit to the `highprio` QOS instead, which has extra resources and higher priority (and therefore the usage is also billed 2x), however this must first be discussed among the owners of the hardware (PI's), and then you must contact an administrator to grant your user permission to submit jobs to it.

## Job priority
When a job is submitted a priority value is calculated based on several factors, where a higher number indicates a higher priority in the queue. This does not impact running jobs, and the effect of prioritization is only noticable when the cluster is operating near peak capacity, or when the hardware partition to which the job has been submitted is nearly fully allocated. Otherwise jobs will usually start immediately as long as there are resources available and you haven't reached the [maximum CPU's per user limit](#qos-info-and-limitations).

Different weights are given to the individual priority factors, where the most significant ones are the account fair-share factor (described in more detail below) and the QOS, as described above. All factors are normalized to a value between 0-1, then weighted by an adjustable scalar, which may be adjusted occasionally depending on the overall cluster usage. Users can also be nice to other users and reduce the priority of their own jobs by setting a "nice" value using `--nice` when submitting for example less time-critical jobs. Job priorities are then calculated according to the following formula:

```
Job_priority =
	(PriorityWeightQOS) * (QOS_factor)
	(PriorityWeightAge) * (age_factor) +
	(PriorityWeightFairshare) * (fair-share_factor) +
	(PriorityWeightJobSize) * (job_size_factor) -
	- nice_factor
```

To obtain the current configured weights use `sprio -w`:
```
$ sprio -w
  JOBID PARTITION   PRIORITY       SITE        AGE  FAIRSHARE    JOBSIZE        QOS
Weights                               1        200        600       1808       1000
```

The priority of pending jobs will be shown in the job queue when running `squeue`. To see the exact contributions of each factor to the priority of a pending job use `sprio -j <jobid>`:
```
$ sprio -j 1282256
  JOBID PARTITION   PRIORITY       SITE        AGE  FAIRSHARE    JOBSIZE        QOS
1282256 general          586          0        129        619        138          0
```

The job **age** and **size** factors are important to avoid the situation where large jobs can get stuck in the queue for a long time because smaller jobs will always fit in everywhere much more easily. The age factor will max out to `1.0` when 3 days of queue time has been accrued for any job. The job size factor is directly proportional to the number of CPUs requested, regardless of the time limit, and is normalized to the total number of CPUs in the cluster. Therefore the weight of it will always be configured to be equal to the total number of (physical) CPUs available in the cluster.

### The fair-share factor
As the name implies, the fair-share factor is used to ensure that users within each account have their fair share of computing resources made available to them over time. Because the individual research groups have contributed with different amounts of hardware to the cluster, the overall share of computing resources made available to them should match accordingly. Secondly, the resource usage of individual users within each account is important to consider as well, so that users who may recently have vastly overused their shares within each account will not have the highest priority. The goal of the fair-share factor is to balance the usage of all users by adjusting job priorities, so that it's possible for everyone to use their fair share of computing resources over time. The fair-share factor is calculated according to the [fair-tree algorithm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/archive/slurm-23.02.6/fair_tree.html), which is an integrated part of the SLURM scheduler. It has been configured with a usage decay half-life of 2 weeks, and the usage is completely reset at the first day of each month.

To see the current fair-share factor for your user and the amount of shares available for each account, you can run `sshare`:

```

  - `RawShares`: the amount of "shares" assigned to each account (in our setup simply the number of CPUs each account has contributed with)
  - `NormShares`: the fraction of shares given to each account normalized to the total shares available across all accounts, e.g. a value of 0.33 means an account has been assigned 33% of all the resources available in the cluster.
  - `RawUsage`: usage of all jobs charged to the account or user. The value will decay over time depending on the usage decay half-life configured. The `RawUsage` for an account is the sum of the `RawUsage` for each user within the account, thus indicative of which users have contributed the most to the accountâ€™s overall score.
  - `EffectvUsage`: `RawUsage` divided by the **total** `RawUsage` for the cluster, hence the column always sums to `1.0`. `EffectvUsage` is therefore the percentage of the total cluster usage the account has actually used (in relation to the total usage, NOT the total capacity). In the example above, the `ma` account has used `44.23%` of the total cluster usage since the last usage reset.
  - `FairShare`: The fair-share score calculated using the following formula `FS = 2^(-EffectvUsage/NormShares)`. The `FairShare` score can be interpreted by the following intervals: 
    - 1.0: **Unused**. The account has not run any jobs since the last usage reset.
    - 0.5 - 1.0: **Underutilization**. The account is underutilizing their granted share. For example a value of 0.75 means the account has underutilized their share 1:2
    - 0.5: **Average utilization**. The account on average is using exactly as much as their granted share.
    - 0.0 - 0.5: **Over-utilization**. The account is overusing their granted share. For example a value of 0.75 means the account has recently overutilized their share 2:1
    - 0: No share left. The account is vastly overusing their granted share and users will get the lowest possible priority.

???+ tip "The fair-share factor and CPU efficiency"
      The value of the fair-share factor is calculated based on CPU usage in units of **allocation seconds** and **not** CPU seconds, which is normally the unit used for CPU usage reported by the `sreport` and `sacct` commands. Therefore, this also means that the CPU efficiency of past jobs directly impacts how much actual work can be done by the allocated CPUs for each user within each account before their fair share of resources is consumed for the period.

For more details about job prioritization see the [SLURM documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/archive/slurm-23.02.6/priority_multifactor.html) and this [presentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/SLUG19/Priority_and_Fair_Trees.pdf).

### Undergraduate students
Undergraduate students (up to but NOT including master projects) share resources within the `students` account and only their combined usage is limited. View current limitations with for example:

```
$ sacctmgr list account students -s format="account,priority,MaxCPUs,grpcpus,qos" | head -n 3

## Job resource usage summary
### Running jobs
Use [`sstat`](https://slurm.schedmd.com/archive/slurm-23.02.6/sstat.html) to show the status and live usage accounting information of only **running** jobs. For batch scripts you need to add `.batch` to the job ID, for example:
```
$ sstat <job_id>.batch
```

This will print EVERY metric, so it's nice to select only a few most relevant ones, for example:

```
$ sstat --jobs <job_id>.batch --format=jobid,avecpu,maxrss,ntasks
```

??? "Useful format variables"
      | Variable | Description |
      | --- | --- |
      | avecpu | Average CPU time of all tasks in job. |
      | averss | Average resident set size of all tasks. |
      | avevmsize | Average virtual memory of all tasks in a job. |
      | jobid | The id of the Job. |
      | maxrss | Maximum number of bytes read by all tasks in the job. |
      | maxvsize | Maximum number of bytes written by all tasks in the job. |
      | ntasks | Number of tasks in a job. |
      
      For all variables see the [SLURM documentation](https://slurm.schedmd.com/archive/slurm-23.02.6/sstat.html#SECTION_Job-Status-Fields)

### Past jobs
To view the status of **past** jobs and their usage accounting information use [`sacct`](https://slurm.schedmd.com/archive/slurm-23.02.6/sacct.html). `sacct` will return **everything** accounted for by default which is very inconvenient to view in a terminal window, so the below command will show the most essential information:
```
$ sacct -o jobid,jobname,start,end,NNodes,NCPUS,ReqMem,CPUTime,AveRSS,MaxRSS --user=$USER --units=G -j 138
JobID           JobName               Start                 End   NNodes      NCPUS     ReqMem    CPUTime     AveRSS     MaxRSS

```

There are a huge number of other options to show, see [SLURM docs](https://slurm.schedmd.com/archive/slurm-23.02.6/sacct.html#SECTION_Job-Accounting-Fields). If you really want to see everything use `sacct --long > file.txt` and dump it into a file or else it's too much for the terminal.

```

## Job efficiency summary
### Individual jobs
To view the efficiencies of individual jobs use `seff`, for example:

```
$ seff 2357
Job ID: 2357
Cluster: biocloud
User/Group: <username>
State: COMPLETED (exit code 0)
Nodes: 1
Cores per node: 96
CPU Utilized: 60-11:06:29
CPU Efficiency: 45.76% of 132-02:48:00 core-walltime
Job Wall-clock time: 1-09:01:45
Memory Utilized: 383.42 GB
Memory Efficiency: 45.11% of 850.00 GB
```

This information will also be shown in notification emails when jobs finish.

### Multiple jobs
Perhaps a more useful way to use `sacct` is through the [reportseff](https://github.com/troycomi/reportseff) tool (pre-installed), which can be used to calculate the CPU, memory, and time efficiencies of past jobs, so that you can optimize future jobs and ensure resources are utilized to the max (**2TM**). For example:
```
$ reportseff -u $(whoami) --format partition,jobid,state,jobname,alloccpus,reqmem,elapsed,cputime,CPUEff,MemEff,TimeEff -S r,pd,s --since d=4
  Partition     JobID        State                       JobName                    AllocCPUS     ReqMem   Elapsed        CPUTime      CPUEff   MemEff   TimeEff

In the example above, way too much memory was requested for all the jobs in general, and also the time limits were way too long. The most important is the CPU efficiency, however, which was generally good except for one job, but it was a very small job.

## Usage reports
`sreport` can be used to summarize usage in many different ways, below are some examples.

### Account usage by user
```
