# Shell access
Obtain a shell in the browser by clicking **Clusters** and then **biocloud Shell Access**:

![web portal shell button](img/shell_button.png)

Enter your password when prompted:

![web portal shell password](img/shellpwd.png)

And you should now see the message of the day and a prompt in the exact same way as when [accessing through SSH](../../access/ssh.md):

![web portal shell motd](img/shellmotd.png)

You can even choose between different themes at the top right if you want.
