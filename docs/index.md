# Introduction
Welcome to the documentation website for the BioCloud HPC cluster at the Section of Chemistry and Biotechnology at Aalborg University. Here, youâ€™ll find everything you need to get started with accessing and using the cluster for scientific computing. The system is managed by the [SLURM workload manager](https://slurm.schedmd.com/archive/slurm-24.11.4/overview.html), which efficiently handles job scheduling and resource allocation for hundreds of simultaneous users through isolated computing jobs.

The current cluster consists of data center-grade servers equipped with dual-socket AMD EPYC CPUs of various sizes and generations. These servers have been contributed by individual research groups through their own research grants. In total, the cluster provides **3264** CPU cores and **20 TB** of shared memory, all connected to a **2 PB** [CephFS](https://ceph.com/) networked storage cluster.

To gain access, you must first contact an administrator to grant access to your AAU user account. Then, please read everything on this website before starting to use the cluster.
